            <h2>The Roots of Renew Body</h2>
            <p>
                Renew Body Therapy was founded to solve a real problem that many people in the community face,
                long waiting lists for physiotherapy and occupational therapy services. After nearly a decade working
                within the NHS across acute and community settings, our founder saw first-hand how delays in
                treatment can negatively affect recovery and quality of life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Driven by a desire to offer accessible, affordable, and honest care, Renew Body Therapy was created to
                give people the chance to receive the right treatment at the right time. There is deep personal
                satisfaction in helping someone walk out of the clinic happier and more comfortable than when they
                arrived, and that feeling remains at the heart of the business today.
                Every client matters, every outcome matters, and every treatment plan is tailored to the individual.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Professional Background &amp; Clinical Expertise</h2>
            <p>
                With nearly 10 years of NHS experience, our clinician brings extensive knowledge from working across:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Trauma orthopaedics</li>
                <li>Stroke neurology</li>
                <li>Respiratory care</li>
                <li>Cardiology</li>

                <li>Vascular surgery</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This clinical foundation ensures that every assessment and treatment plan is rooted in evidence-based
                practice and a deep understanding of how the body works. In addition to a BSc in Occupational Therapy,
                the practitioner is qualified with a Level 3 Sports Massage Diploma, enabling skilled treatment of
                muscular, postural, and injury-related conditions.

            <p>
                Clients benefit from a rare combination of medical training and hands-on therapy experience, delivered
                by someone who understands both acute and long-term rehabilitation.
            </p>
