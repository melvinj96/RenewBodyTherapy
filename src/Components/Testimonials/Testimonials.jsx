The music was calming, the room was warm, lighting and scents were not overpowering at all and his hands were simply magic! I have had back pain for a few weeks now and pretty much instantly i could feel a difference. 'Look, I can move' was the first thing i said to my partner as i came home. The massage was amazing. Perfect amount of pressure applied and I feel great. So I highly recommend him and I will be making this my monthly treat now üòä",
